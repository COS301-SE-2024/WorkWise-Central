	\section*{Introduction}	
	
	This document outlines all the requirements for the WorkWise Central project, detailing the system as a whole and specifying the essential functionalities it must provide.\\
	
	Small to medium domestic service delivery businesses often face significant operational challenges, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive software system that caters to their unique needs. This lack of suitable technology can hinder efficient organization and management, making it difficult for these businesses to operate smoothly. The situation is exacerbated for those businesses that lack the resources to hire personnel dedicated to managing and organizing operations. Consequently, inefficiencies can arise, leading to missed opportunities, decreased productivity, and ultimately, reduced client satisfaction.\\
	
	This is where WorkWise Central comes in. WorkWise Central is designed as a progressive web app (PWA) specifically targeted at small to medium domestic service delivery businesses. The primary goal of WorkWise Central is to streamline the operations of these businesses by seamlessly integrating various essential management systems. These include job management, inventory management, client management, and employee management. By consolidating these functions into a single, cohesive platform, WorkWise Central serves as a central hub that connects the different aspects and stakeholders involved in the business.\\
	
	The features provided by WorkWise Central allows for enhanced coordination and efficiency across the businessâ€™s operations. Job management functionalities ensure that tasks are tracked, scheduled, and completed in an organized manner, minimizing delays and errors. Inventory management helps keep track of stock levels, ensuring that materials and supplies are always available when needed, which improves service delivery times. Client management features enable businesses to maintain detailed records of customer interactions and preferences, facilitating personalized service and fostering long-term relationships. Employee management capabilities allow for efficient scheduling, performance tracking, and communication, ensuring that the workforce is well-coordinated and productive.\\
	
	By bringing these critical functions together in one accessible platform, WorkWise Central not only enhances the internal efficiency of the businesses but also significantly boosts client satisfaction. Clients benefit from more reliable and timely service delivery, clearer communication, and overall better service experiences. In turn, this improved client satisfaction can lead to increased customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and ultimately, business growth.\\

	\section*{User stories / user characteristics}
	The users of the system is only employees of a service delivery company. The system is designed to be customisable, therefore the classification of each type of employee can differ between companies that use the system. Furthermore, a company can have only one or many employees. For the purposes of this document, we will specify the intended users based on the default types of employee and explain what each of them will want to use the system for. \\
	
	The system has two main user categories: Users that deal with business management \& admin and users that are providing the services to customers. We will consider the users in each of these categories:
	
	\subsection*{Management users}
	\begin{list}{\arabic{enumileveli}.}{\usecounter{enumileveli}}
		\item \textbf{Business owner:} They want to use this system to be able to know what is going on in their business. They want to see how the business is performing. They want to be able to verify that their workers are doing what needs to be done (i.e. ensure jobs are being completed in a timely manner). They want to make sure that they minimize losses for improper inventory tracking. The need the system to give them an overview of everything happening in the business.
		\item \textbf{Admin employee:} These users are concerned with admin related tasks, such as adding jobs to the system, adding clients to the system, allocating jobs to employees, adding new employees and following up on client payments.
		\item \textbf{Inventory manager:} These users are concerned with managing the inventory of the business. They want to see what inventory has been used in the day. They want to know what inventory is low on stock so that they can reorder. They want to be able to update the inventory after an order has arrived. They also want to be able to add or delete items from the inventory. 
	\end{list}
	
	\subsection*{Service delivery users}
	\begin{list}{\arabic{enumileveli}.}{\usecounter{enumileveli}}
		\item \textbf{Supervisor:} These users want to be able to see what the employees under them are doing and how they are performing. They want to see what jobs each employee under them have been assigned. They want to be able to view the status of each of these jobs. 
		\item \textbf{Team leader:} These users are interested in what their team needs to get done. They want to know all the jobs allocated to their team and when it needs to happen. They are also concerned with quoting and invoicing customers.
		\item \textbf{Regular employee:} These users want to see what jobs they have to do. They want to see the details of the job and they want to be able to record what they are doing at the job as easily and seamlessly as possible. They also want to have their working hours to be tracked.
