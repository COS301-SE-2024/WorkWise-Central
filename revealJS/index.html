            <h2>Our project management</h2>
            <p>We are following the Agile approach</p>
            <p>
              Our project is divided into sprints, each sprint is roughly 2
              weeks long.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each sprint consists of sprint planning, daily stand-ups,
              development and sprint review and retrospectives
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Sprint planning, review and retrospectives</h2>
            <p>
              We make use of a combination of google docs and github boards.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of every sprint we will review the work done and create
              a backlog of anything that was not fully completed (on google
              docs). After which we conducted the retrospective
            </p>
            <p>
              After the review and retrospective we plan for the next sprint,
              where we always prioritise anything on the backlog from the
              previous sprint. This is also gone on google docs
            </p>
            <p>
              After these meetings, everything from the planning meeting is made
              into issues and allocated to the team members.

            >
            <p>
              We use github boards for our project management. It was chosen for
              the following reasons
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free to use</li>
              <li>Integrates with all the activity on github</li>
              <li>
                Reduces the spead of 'information' in the team. Having a
                separate platform mean everyone needs to keep track of that as
                well
              </li>
              <li>Has the functionality we need.</li>

            <p>This meeting tends to be on Thursdays.</p>
            <p>
              The purpose of the meeting is to give the client an update on the
              progress of the project and to get feedback from the client.
            </p>
            <p>We also have ad hoc meeting with the client as needed.</p>

            <p>
              This meeting is to get feedback from him and to get guidance on
              the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this we contact him for any clarification we may
              need.

            </p>

            <h2>Sprint planning</h2>
            <p>Our sprint planning is done using our Github project board.</p>
            <p>
              Everything that needs to be done in the print is added as an issue
              and given the relivant dates, priorities, size and allocated to a
              member.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the spring goes along any changes to what needs to be done is
              updated in on our board.

              Our roadmap is grouped by priority. It also features the
              milestones, such as this demo
            </p>
            <p>
              The roadmap was sliced by sprint to make it easy for us to see

              This is the same as the Backlog, just sliced per memeber of the
