						<h2>Our project management</h2>
						<p>We are following the Agile approach</p>
						<p>Our project is divided into sprints, each sprint is roughly 2 weeks long.</p>
						<p>Each sprint consists of sprint planning, daily stand-ups, development and sprint review</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Sprint planning</h2>
						<p>Our sprint planning is done using our Github project board. </p>
						<p>Everything that needs to be done in the print is added as an issue and given the relivant dates, priorities, size and allocated to a member.</p>
						<p>As the spring goes along any changes to what needs to be done is updated in on our board.</p>
					</section>
