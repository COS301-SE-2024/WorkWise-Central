# Introduction
This document outlines all the requirements for the WorkWise Central project, detailing the system as a whole and specifying the essential functionalities it must provide.
	
Small to medium domestic service delivery businesses often face significant operational challenges, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive software system that caters to their unique needs. This lack of suitable technology can hinder efficient organization and management, making it difficult for these businesses to operate smoothly. The situation is exacerbated for those businesses that lack the resources to hire personnel dedicated to managing and organizing operations. Consequently, inefficiencies can arise, leading to missed opportunities, decreased productivity, and ultimately, reduced client satisfaction.

This is where WorkWise Central comes in. WorkWise Central is designed as a progressive web app (PWA) specifically targeted at small to medium domestic service delivery businesses. The primary goal of WorkWise Central is to streamline the operations of these businesses by seamlessly integrating various essential management systems. These include job management, inventory management, client management, and employee management. By consolidating these functions into a single, cohesive platform, WorkWise Central serves as a central hub that connects the different aspects and stakeholders involved in the business.

The features provided by WorkWise Central allows for enhanced coordination and efficiency across the businessâ€™s operations. Job management functionalities ensure that tasks are tracked, scheduled, and completed in an organized manner, minimizing delays and errors. Inventory management helps keep track of stock levels, ensuring that materials and supplies are always available when needed, which improves service delivery times. Client management features enable businesses to maintain detailed records of customer interactions and preferences, facilitating personalized service and fostering long-term relationships. Employee management capabilities allow for efficient scheduling, performance tracking, and communication, ensuring that the workforce is well-coordinated and productive.

By bringing these critical functions together in one accessible platform, WorkWise Central not only enhances the internal efficiency of the businesses but also significantly boosts client satisfaction. Clients benefit from more reliable and timely service delivery, clearer communication, and overall better service experiences. In turn, this improved client satisfaction can lead to increased customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and ultimately, business growth.
