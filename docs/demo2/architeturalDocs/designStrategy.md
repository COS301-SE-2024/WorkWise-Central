# Architectural design strategy
For this project we are making use of two main approves: decomposition and design based on quality requirements

#### Decomposition
We have broken the system down into subsystems and components. This decision is optimal for division of labour, allowing the team to work independently on specific aspects of a subsystem. As a result, our efficiency and understanding of the system as a whole is greatly improved.

#### Quality requirements 
The use of this design strategy requires us to identify the crucial quality requirements of the system and then designing the system in such a way that ensures the quality requirements are met. By using this approach we ensure that the system will be useable, reliable and secure.
