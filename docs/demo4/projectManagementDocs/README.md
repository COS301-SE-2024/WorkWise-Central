# Introduction

This section documents the project management for the WorkWise central project

## Development methodology
For this project we made use of the agile development methodology 

### Sprints 
In the start of the project we had an average of 2 week long sprints, however as the project progressed we found it to be more useful to have 1 week long sprints

### Daily Standup  
Our team had a daily standup at 8:30 am throughout the project

### Sprint reviews and retrospective
At the end of every sprint we would conduct a sprint review, in which we went through the system to see what work still had to be completed. After this we had a retrospective in which we would speak about what we think went well in the sprint and what we could improve in the sprint.

### Sprint planning

## Project management tool used 
We primarily used the [github board]("https://github.com/orgs/COS301-SE-2024/projects/59") functionality. We chose to use the github board for a number of reasons. Firstly, most other platform require you to pay for the service, which we could not do. In addition, having the project board directly linked to the github issues made it a lot easier to keep track of the development. In addition to this, using few different platforms meant that information did not get lost as easily and made it more convenient for our team to use 

We also made use of tools such as [google docs]("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16QXX7aCOoTryKgl8DtTNVQI0E9t2uonv?usp=sharing"), discord and whatsapp. Google docs was primarily used for meeting notes and if any information need to be noted down in a central place. Discord was used to coding sessions and ad hoc meetings. Whatsapp was used to communicated amounts ourselves 

## The workflow 
At the start of every sprint we would conduct a sprint planning meeting, in which we will detail what needs to happen in the sprint and allocate tasks to each team member. This was all done on google docs.

After this everything that needs to be done would be made into issues on our github board.

As the team members worked on the issues they would move them to the reliant status and comment on the issues to say what is happening with the issue.

Once the issue was complete the team member would link the reliant pull request to the issue and place it in a review state. Once the team leader verified that the work was completed and in the develop branch, the issue would be closed

After the sprint was over, the team would conduct a sprint review and retrospective. In the review, all the work that was not completed would be noted down to be completed in the next sprint. In the retrospective the team would answer the following questions: "What went well?" "What could be improved?"

## Meetings with mentors
Our team has weekly meetings with our university mentor Liam. In these meetings we would ask him for advise if needed as well as give him an update on our progress.

Our team had meeting with our client on average every 2 to 3 weeks in which we give them an update on the system as well as ask for help or advice if needed.
