# User Characteristics
The users of the system are only employees of a service delivery company. Each user of the system is
an employee of one or multiple companies. The system is intended to be customisable, therefore the
classification of each type of employee can differ between companies that use the system. Furthermore,
a company can have only one or many employees. For the purposes of this document, we will specify
the intended users based on the default types of employee and explain what each of them will want to
use the system for.
The system has two main user categories: Users that deal with business management & admin and users
that are providing the services to customers. We will consider the users in each of these categories:
## Management users
1. Business owner: They want to use this system to be able to know what is going on in their
business. They want to see how the business is performing. They want to be able to verify that
their workers are doing what needs to be done (i.e. ensure jobs are being completed in a timely
manner). They want to make sure that they minimize losses for improper inventory tracking. The
need the system to give them an overview of everything happening in the business.
2. Admin employee: These users are concerned with admin related tasks, such as adding jobs to
the system, adding clients to the system, allocating jobs to employees, adding new employees and
following up on client payments.
3. Inventory manager: These users are concerned with managing the inventory of the business.
They want to see what inventory has been used in the day. They want to know what inventory
is low on stock so that they can reorder. They want to be able to update the inventory after an
order has arrived. They also want to be able to add or delete items from the inventory.
## Service delivery users
1. Supervisor: These users want to be able to see what the employees under them are doing and how
they are performing. They want to see what jobs each employee under them have been assigned.
They want to be able to view the status of each of these jobs.
2. Team leader: These users are interested in what their team needs to get done. They want to
know all the jobs allocated to their team and when it needs to happen. They are also concerned
with quoting and invoicing customers.
3. Regular employee: These users want to see what jobs they have to do. They want to see the
details of the job and they want to be able to record what they are doing at the job as easily and
seamlessly as possible. They also want to have their working hours to be tracked.
