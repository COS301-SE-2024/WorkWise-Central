# Technology Requirements
## Vue
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that allows developers to build web interfaces and single-page applications. It is lightweight and flexible, making it optimal for the performance requirements of the project. Vue.js follows a component-based architecture, enabling the creation of reusable UI components for complex applications. Additionally, its reactive data binding system ensures automatic UI updates when data changes.
### Pros
- Vue.js offers fast rendering and fast change detection mechanisms.
- Reusability of components, to streamline development time
- Powerful set of tools for development and testing
### Cons
- Vue is a relatively new framework and has a smaller community than React and Angular.
- Vue.js has a less extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and plugins compared to React and Angular.
## Nest.js
Nest.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using Node.js.
### Pros
- Nest.js uses typescript, and thus provides strong typing, static analysis, and better tooling, resulting in more robust code.
- Nest.js has a modular architecture, allowing developers to create reusable modules and components. 
- Nest.js leverages dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and write testable code.
### Cons
1. Nest.js projects are prone to circular dependencies, which the development team needs to account for.
2. Nest.js has a smaller ecosystem of third-party packages and plugins compared to other Node.js frameworks like Express.
