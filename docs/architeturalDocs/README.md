# Architectural Documentation 
This section details the architectural design for the WorkWise Central. This section  provides an overview of the system's architecture, design principles, and the rationale behind key technical decisions.

The primary purpose of this documentation is to provide a clear and concise description of the system architecture, outline the high-level design and structure of the system and explain the reasoning behind architectural choices and trade-offs.


## System overview
Our system consists of a frontend client, an API-gateway, and a MongoDB database. The system is designed to be a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with extensibility in mind.
## Design Strategy
The architectural design strategy for this software engineering project is primarily based on **elicitation from non-functional requirements**. These requirements were established through communication with the client and within our team.

The strategy involves identifying the key quality requirements for the system, and designing to meet those requirements. It ensures that the system will be highly usable, secure and reliable.
