<h2 id="design-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-strategy"><span>Design Strategy</span></a></h2>
<p>The architectural design strategy for this software engineering project is primarily based on <strong>elicitation from non-functional requirements</strong>. These requirements were established through communication with the client and within our team.</p>
<p>The strategy involves identifying the key quality requirements for the system, and designing to meet those requirements. It ensures that the system will be highly usable, secure and reliable.</p>
