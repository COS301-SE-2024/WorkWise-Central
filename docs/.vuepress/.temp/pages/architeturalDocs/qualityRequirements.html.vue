<h2 id="usability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#usability"><span>Usability</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The systemâ€™s usability depends on how easily users can interact with it.. The system should be clear and easy to understand. The users should be able to easily navigate through the application, with minimal need for guidance external assistance. Users should be able to quickly track their schedule and open communication channels. Users in managerial positions should have a concise view of relevant information about their subordinates' activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification</strong>: User error rates and task completion time will be measured through usability tests, and  maintain specific thresholds. The tests will be conducted with a variety of the identified user-groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#performance"><span>Performance</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Given that the system will facilitate live communication, system performance is crucial. The system must be responsive and maintain a high throughput with multiple, concurrent requests.  The application must have low resource utilisation, to be compatible with mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification</strong>: The performance of the app will be measured using the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Latency</strong> and <strong>Throughput</strong>: The time taken for a request to be processed and a response to be delivered. Low latency ensures real-time communication. The number of requests the system can handle per unit of time.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Utilization</strong>: Monitoring CPU, memory, and network usage to ensure efficient resource allocation. Mobile devices have limited resources, so optimizing utilization is critical.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security"><span>Security</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Security is crucial in the system, due to the application's access to sensitive data related to clients and employees. The system must prevent and be capable of easily recovering from a data breach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification</strong>:  Security will be quantified through the measuring the availability, confidentiality and integrity of the system.
The availability of the system will be determined by the uptime percentage.
Confidentiality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reliability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reliability"><span>Reliability</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The reliability of the system depends on its ability to prevent and recover from failures. In the event of an employee losing internet access, the application must retain its basic functionality, in order to prevent inventory tracking from being inconsistent. Furthermore, the application must have a MTTF  of ...</p>
