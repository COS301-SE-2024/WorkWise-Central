<h2 id="unit-testing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unit-testing"><span>Unit testing</span></a></h2>
<p>Unit testing is a software testing technique that evaluates individual units of source code to verify if they function as expected. WorkWise used two different frameworks to conduct unit tests. We used Jest to test our backend and Cypress to test our frontend.</p>
<h3 id="jest-backend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jest-backend"><span>Jest - backend</span></a></h3>
<p>The Jest framework has been used to conduct the unit tests for WorkWise. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript/Typescript codebase. All of our unit tests in the backend were conducted using automated Jest tests. Refer to our <a href="https://work-wise-central-1.vercel.app/demo4/devOps/cicd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CI/CD</a> section of the documentation for a description of our CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="cypress-frontend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cypress-frontend"><span>Cypress - frontend</span></a></h3>
<p>The Cypress framework has been used to perform the unit tests in frontend for the WorkWise frontend. Cypress is a JavaScript testing framework built to efficiently test modern web applications, ensuring seamless user interactions. This is why we choose to use cypress to perform our unit tests for the frontend. All of our frontend tests have been automated using Cypress. For more details on our continuous testing approach, refer to the <a href="https://work-wise-central-1.vercel.app/demo4/devOps/cicd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CI/CD</a> section of our documentation.</p>

<h2 id="integration-testing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-testing"><span>Integration testing</span></a></h2>
<p>Integration testing is a software testing technique that assesses how multiple components or modules of a system interact with each other to ensure they work together as intended. In the WorkWise project, we employed Jest for integration testing of our backend, allowing us to verify the interactions between controllers, services, and repositories. For our frontend, we utilized Cypress to conduct integration tests, ensuring that various Vue components function correctly together and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<h3 id="jest-backend-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jest-backend-1"><span>Jest - backend</span></a></h3>
<p>The Jest framework has been employed to conduct the integration tests for WorkWise. This powerful testing framework enables us to thoroughly evaluate the interactions between various components of our backend system, including controllers, services, and repositories. By utilizing Jest, we can ensure that these components work together seamlessly and produce the expected outcomes when integrated.</p>
<h3 id="cypress-frontend-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cypress-frontend-1"><span>Cypress - frontend</span></a></h3>
<p>The Cypress framework has been utilized to conduct integration tests for the WorkWise frontend. This advanced testing tool allows us to thoroughly assess the interactions between various Vue components and ensure that they function correctly together within the application. By leveraging Cypress, we can simulate real user interactions, enabling us to validate the overall user experience and verify that all integrated components operate as expected.</p>

<h3 id="cypress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cypress"><span>Cypress</span></a></h3>
<p>The Cypress framework has been employed to conduct end-to-end tests for the WorkWise application. This robust testing tool enables us to simulate real user scenarios and interactions, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the application from the user's perspective. By using Cypress, we can validate the entire workflow, ensuring that all components, including the frontend, backend, and any external services, function cohesively as intended.</p>
<p>Our end-to-end tests cover critical user journeys, such as account registration, login, and data submission processes, allowing us to assess the complete functionality of the application. This thorough testing approach helps us identify any potential issues that may affect the user experience, ensuring that the application operates smoothly and reliably in real-world situations.</p>

<h3 id="user-testing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#user-testing"><span>User testing</span></a></h3>
<p>User testing is a critical phase in the development of the WorkWise application since useability is our main non-functional requirement. It involves evaluating the applicationâ€™s usability, functionality, and overall user experience through direct feedback from actual users.</p>
