<p>For this project we are making use of two main approves: decomposition and design based on quality requirements</p>
<h4 id="decomposition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#decomposition"><span>Decomposition</span></a></h4>
<p>We have broken the system down into subsystems and components. This decision is optimal for division of labour, allowing the team to work independently on specific aspects of a subsystem. As a result, our efficiency and understanding of the system as a whole is greatly improved.</p>
<h4 id="quality-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quality-requirements"><span>Quality requirements</span></a></h4>
<p>The use of this design strategy requires us to identify the crucial quality requirements of the system and then designing the system in such a way that ensures the quality requirements are met. By using this approach we ensure that the system will be useable, reliable and secure.</p>
