Each user of the system is an employee of one or multiple companies. The system is intended to be customisable, therefore the classification of each type of employee can differ between companies that use the system. Furthermore, a company can have only one or many employees. For the purposes of this document, we will specify the intended users based on the default types of employee and explain what each of them will want to use the system for. The system has two main user categories: Users that deal with business management &amp; admin and users that are providing the services to customers. We will consider the users in each of these categories:</p><h2 id="management-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#management-users"><span>Management users</span></a></h2><ol><li>Business owner: They want to use this system to be able to know what is going on in their business.

They want to make sure that they minimize losses for improper inventory tracking.
